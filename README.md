# Homelessness

## Description
This project will look at the homelessness in the USA. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) argues that local market factors are determiants and factors in homelessness. This project is directly motivated by the claim by HUD. This project will look at other models that correlate to local market factors and homelessness, to see if we can produce a model that out peforms the model created by HUD.

## Data
This project utilizes the data set 05b_analysis_file_update.csv and data dictionary HUD TO3 - 05b Analysis File - Data - Dictionary.csv. These two data sets contain information about the locacl market factors and factors about homelessness.
